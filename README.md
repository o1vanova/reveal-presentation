`(Slide - Presentation name)`<br>
Hello!
My name is Olga and today I'd like to talk to you about Vue.js. My presentation is divided into four parts. First, I will talk about the origins of Vue.js. Then I will look at advantages over other frameworks and I will try to answer the question of why you should use it. Next, I will talk about the basics of using Vue.js. And finally, I will demonstrate how it works.

`(Slide - History)`<br>
Now, let's start with history. Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google. His job involved a lot of prototyping in the browser. And Evan wanted to create something that affords to make it as fast as possible. At that time some of the projects used Angular but Angular was too heavy. So in 2013, Evan started to work something, which would be lightweight and consist only of minimal features. In February 2014 he put the first release of Vue.js on Github. Although it was the first Evan's project, it got several hundred stars in the first week.

`(Slide - Companies)`<br>
Nowadays, its popularity is still growing. This picture illustrates that even large companies use Vue.js. And I have to tell you, that is not the most complete list.
